# Practice-accessibility-site

Starting of i edited this project so that i can start learning to put HTML elements throughout my source code to improve accessibility for the customer and for any collaborators. This project solves the problem that was in it before, which was that any person using a screen reader would not have been able to understand what the images were displaying. In addition to this the source code had minimal structure before which would made it harder for anybody viewing the code to understand it and break it down. However in the process of adding the html elements and making the site more accessible i saw how if it was not done the right way you could alter the structure of the site, messing up the layout etc.Last of all i learnt that i need to commit my changes more just incase i ever need to refer to a older piece of code.
